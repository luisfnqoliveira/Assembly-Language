# Assembly-Language
Classwork from CS 447

The main project was done using MIPS assembly langauge and run on the MARS simulator.  It is a concentration card game that is 
printed to the screen using LEDs.  The goal is to match all of the cards on the screen before time runs out. 

Another project was done using a logisim to design a digital circut.  The goal was to create a CPU using logisim to run a small version of the MIPS instruction set.
